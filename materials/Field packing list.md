Some definitions... 
	'*sample*' = one collecton of seawater, either 2x1L bottles (treatment) plus 1x1L bottle (control) or 1xMetaprobe with 3xgauze-cotton rolls
	'*sampling event*' = the collection of samples either Metaprobe, water bottle, or both, but must be taken at the same location, i.e. one sampling event, one location, possibly many samples
	'*citizen science sample*' = one Metaprobe sample, taken at one location


For **sampling with tour operators**:
	Two sampling events, 2 samples each (one Metaprobe and one water bottle)
	Pack for 2 Metaprobe samples, and 2 Water bottle samples
- Standard Field protocol
- Include CS Materials (some not all): What's in my bag for kids, project description, who to contact sheet.
- Kit goes in a **sterile** cool box/transport box to the tour operator in the morning, and you collect it when they return to harbour the same day
- Pack data notebook 
- Pack response box

For **sampling with citizen science operators**:
	One sampling event, one sample each
	Pack for 1 Metaprobe sample 
- CS Materials packet: project description sheet, What's in my sampling bag protocol for adults, whats in my bag for Kids, contact sheet, qr code to how to video, data recording sheet
- small trash bag for used gloves
- Kit goes in zip-lock bags, with them before their trip.
- Provide them with a cooler if they do not have one. 


### Water bottle kit 

One sample includes two 1L treatment sample bottles and one 1L control sample bottle.

*Before packing, all equipment must be cleaned with a 10% bleach solution, and all consumables must be sterile.* 

Pack the following consumables for ONE SAMPLE:
- two 1L sterile water bottles (treatment)
- one 1L sterile water bottle (control)
- cool box, cleaned with 10% bleach solution
- one ice pack, frozen and wiped with 10% bleach solution
- medical gloves, 4 gloves per person on sampling trip, in a sealed zip loc bag
- spray bottle with 10% bleach solution
- for some vessels: orange bucket, sprayed with 10% bleach solution

Place all equipment inside the cool box. 

Often, on trips with tour operators there will be TWO sampling events, so you will need to pack TWO sets of the above list, since you will be collecting two samples. In these cases, you do not need to pack two cool boxes, but rather double everything else and store in one cool box. 
You will need one cool box per operator. 


### Metaprobe kit

One sample includes three gauze-cotton rolls within ONE Metaprobe. 

*Before packing, all equipment must be cleaned with a 10% bleach solution, and all consumables must be sterile.* Prepare sampling equipment and kit bags on surfaces sprayed and wiped with 10% bleach solution.

Pack the following consumables for ONE SAMPLE:
- one Metaprobe zip-tied shut, three-cotton rolls inside zip tied individually, with D-ring-weight line attached, in a separate plastic bag
- small cool box, cleaned with 10% bleach solution
- one ice pack, frozen and wiped with 10% bleach solution
- three greiner tubes with 30mL 90% ethanol, pre-labelled with event ID (see image)
- hand line with buoy
- spare zip ties (3)
- scissors
- medical gloves, 4 gloves of two different sizes (typically S/M and XL), in a sealed zip loc bag
- spray bottle with 10% bleach solution (a mini bottle for CS)

Place the Greiner tubes in the cool box with the ice pack. Place everythign else in a transport box or transport bag.
