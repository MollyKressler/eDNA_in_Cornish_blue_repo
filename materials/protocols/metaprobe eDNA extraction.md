One Metaprobe 2.0 sample consists of 3 cotton-gauze rolls suspended in 98% ethanol in 50mL centrifuge tubes. The following protocol is for laboratory based extraction of eDNA from rolls of cotton-gauze from one sample. 

1. Put gloves one. Blot gauze rolls prior to extraction with dry paper roll.
2. Cut the gauze rolls in half. Then cut these further into 4 small pieces. 
3. Prepare a 50mL centrifuge tube with 400uL of extraction buffer (0.5M EDTA pH 8, 1M Urea) and 20uL of proteinase K (100ug/mL). Place the cut pieces from one roll inside the tube. Repeat for all three rolls per sample, one tube per roll. 
4. Incubate samples at 37ÂºC for at least 8hrs.
5. Centrifuge samples at 4000rpm to separate lysate from residual particulates. 
6. Pipette the super latent to an Amicon ultra-4 30K centrifugal device. Pipette 150uL of solution to QIAQuickSpin Columns and purify with QIAQuick PCR purification kits. 
7. Separately, prepare a negative extraction control: 400uL buffer with 20uL of proteinase K.
